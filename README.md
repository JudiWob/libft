🧠 My own C standard library — implemented from scratch as part of the 42 school curriculum.

## 📚 About

**libft** is the first project in the 42 school program. 
Its purpose is to reimplement key functions from the C standard library, and create a foundation for future C projects. 
It was designed to deepen understanding of memory management, pointers, and overall C programming fundamentals.

## ✅ Allowed functions
• write
• malloc
• free


## 🚀 Features

The `libft` project is divided into multiple parts:

### Part 1 – Standard Lib Functions
Reimplemented standard C library functions, including:
- `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strncmp`, `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, etc.

### Part 2 – Additional Utility Functions
Useful helper functions for string manipulation, memory allocation, and character checks:
- `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_split`, `ft_itoa`, `ft_strdup`, etc.

### Bonus Part – Linked List Utilities
Functions for managing singly linked lists:
- `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`, `ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`
